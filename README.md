# News-Headline-Sarcasm-Detection

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>As part of my data science journey, I undertook a project focused on sarcasm detection in news headlines. The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying whether a news headline is sarcastic or not.</p>
<br>
<p>I constructed a neural network model using Python and Keras, a popular deep learning library. The model incorporated an embedding layer to convert the textual data into meaningful numerical representations, followed by an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer that captured sequential patterns and dependencies in the headlines. Additionally, I included a dropout layer to prevent overfitting and a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function to produce a binary output representing the probability of sarcasm.</p>

<p>To train and evaluate the model, I utilized a labeled dataset of news headlines, performing data preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. I split the data into training and testing sets, and assessed the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, I visualized the results using techniques like confusion matrices and word clouds to gain insights into the model's predictions.</p>

<p>This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques for text classification. By successfully developing and evaluating a sarcasm detection model, I demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, neural network architecture design, and performance evaluation. The project showcased my ability to tackle real-world problems and leverage machine learning to derive meaningful insights from textual data.</p>
